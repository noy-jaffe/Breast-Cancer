**Hackaton: Detecting Attributes of Breast Cancer**

Breast cancer is one of the most pervasive malignant diseases among women in the world and in Israel in particular.
If treated early and appropriately, the chance of remission is high.1 In this task we were given (anonymized) data of breast cancer patients treated in Israel over the last years. Our task is to predict certain medical characteristics of the disease for each patient based on their available data. 
This can help save doctor’s time, validate and “double-check” their decisions, and alleviate the cost of expensive tests.
